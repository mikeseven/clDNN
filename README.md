---

The software dependencies are:
- [CMake\*](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.6 or later  
(the project is compatible with CMake 3.1, but, due to issues with boost libraries resolution
in CMake 3.4.3 and with CheckCXXCompilerFlag module in CMake 3.5.2, we strongly recommend 3.6+)
- C++ compiler with partiall or full C++14 standard support compatible with:
    * GNU\* Compiler Collection 5.2 or later
    * clang 3.5 or later
    * [Intel® C++ Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-studio-xe) 17.0 or later
    * Visual C++ 2015 (MSVC++ 19.0) or later

> Intel® CPU intrinsics header (`<immintrin.h>`) must be available during compilation.

- [python™](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7 or later (scripts are both compatible with python™ 2.7.x and python™ 3.x)
- *(optional)* [Doxygen\*](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) 1.8.13 or later  
    Needed for manual generation of documentation from inline comments or running `docs` custom target which will generate it automatically.

> [GraphViz\*](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php) (2.38 or later) is also recommended to generate documentation with all embedded diagrams.  
(Make sure that `dot` application is visible in the `PATH` environment variable.)

---

- The software was validated on:
    * CentOS* 7.2 with GNU* Compiler Collection 5.2 (64-bit only), using Intel® intel-opencl-r.5.0 (SRB5.0) [Linux driver package](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers) .
    * Windows® 10 and Windows® Server 2012 R2 with MSVC 14.0, using [Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows* [15.46] driver package](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26941).

	More information on Intel® OpenCL™ drivers can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers).

We recommend to use SRB5.0 for Linux and 15.46 driver for Windows.

## Installation

### Building

Download [clDNN source code](https://github.com/01org/cldnn/archive/master.zip)
or clone the repository to your system:

```
    git clone https://github.com/01org/cldnn.git
```

Satisfy all software dependencies and ensure that the versions are correct before building.

clDNN uses multiple 3<sup>rd</sup>-party components. They are stored in binary form in `common` subdirectory. Currently they are prepared for MSVC++ and GCC\*. They will be cloned with repository.

---

clDNN uses a CMake-based build system. You can use CMake command-line tool or CMake GUI (`cmake-gui`) to generate required solution.  
For Windows system, you can call in `cmd` (or `powershell`):
```shellscript
    @REM Generate 32-bit solution (solution contains multiple build configurations)...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ..
    @REM Generate 64-bit solution (solution contains multiple build configurations)...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
```  
Created solution can be opened in Visual Studio 2015 or built using appropriate `msbuild` tool
(you can also use `cmake --build .` to select build tool automatically).

For Unix and Linux systems:
```shellscript
    @REM Create GNU makefile for release clDNN and build it...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make
    @REM Create Ninja makefile for debug clDNN and build it...
    cmake -E make_directory build && cd build && cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && ninja -k 20
```

You can call also scripts in main directory of project which will create solutions/makefiles for clDNN (they
will generate solutions/makefiles in `build` subdirectory and binary outputs will be written to `build/out` subdirectory):
- `create_msvc_mscc.bat` (Windows\*, Visual Studio\* 2015)
- `create_unixmake_gcc.sh [Y|N] [<devtoolset-version>]` (Linux\*, GNU\* or Ninja\* makefiles, optional devtoolset support)
    * If you specify the first parameter as `Y`, the Ninja makefiles will be generated.
    * If you specify second parameter (number), the CMake will be called via `scl` with selected `devtoolset` version.

CMake solution offers multiple options which you can specify using normal CMake syntax (`-D<option-name>=<value>`):

| CMake option                              | Type     | Description                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE                        | STRING   | Build configuration that will be used by generated makefiles (it does not affect multi-configuration generators like generators for Visual Studio solutions). Currently supported: `Debug` (default), `Release` |
| CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX                    | PATH     | Install directory prefix.                                                    |
| CLDNN\_\_ARCHITECTURE\_TARGET             | STRING   | Architecture of target system (where binary output will be deployed). CMake will try to detect it automatically (based on selected generator type, host OS and compiler properties). Specify this option only if CMake has problem with detection. Currently supported: `Windows32`, `Windows64`, `Linux64` |
| CLDNN\_\_OUTPUT\_DIR (CLDNN\_\_OUTPUT\_BIN\_DIR, CLDNN\_\_OUTPUT\_LIB\_DIR) | PATH | Location where built artifacts will be written to. It is set automatically to roughly `build/out/<arch-target>/<build-type>` subdirectory. For more control use: `CLDNN__OUTPUT_LIB_DIR` (specifies output path for static libraries) or `CLDNN__OUTPUT_BIN_DIR` (for shared libs and executables). |

|                                           |          |                                                                              |
| CLDNN__INCLUDE_CORE                       | BOOL     | Include core clDNN library project in generated makefiles/solutions. Default: `ON` |
| CLDNN__INCLUDE_TESTS                      | BOOL     | Include tests application project (based on googletest framework) in generated makefiles/solutions . Default: `ON` |
|                                           |          |                                                                              |
| CLDNN__RUN_TESTS                          | BOOL     | Run tests after building `tests` project. This option requires `CLDNN__INCLUDE_TESTS` option to be `ON`. Default: `OFF` |

---

clDNN includes unit tests implemented using the googletest framework. To validate your build, run `tests` target, e.g.:

```
    make tests
```

(Make sure that both `CLDNN__INCLUDE_TESTS` and `CLDNN__RUN_TESTS` were set to `ON` when invoking CMake.)

### Generating documentation

Documentation is provided inline and can be generated in HTML format with Doxygen. We recommend to use latest
[Doxygen\*](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html) and [GraphViz\*](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php).

Documentation templates and configuration files are stored in `docs` subdirectory. You can simply call:

```shellscript
    cd docs && doxygen
```
to generate HTML documentation in `docs/html` subdirectory.

There is also custom CMake target named `docs` which will generate documentation in `CLDNN__OUTPUT_BIN_DIR/html` directory. For example, when using Unix makefiles, you can run:
```
    make docs
```
in order to create it.

### Deployment

Special `install` target will place the API header files and libraries in `/usr/local`
(`C:/Program Files/clDNN` or `C:/Program Files (x86)/clDNN` on Windows). To change
the installation path, use the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>` when invoking CMake.
